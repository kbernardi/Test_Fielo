The base of test case is: check response and scheam.
Auth:  AUTH Must refuse request without x-app-id
       AUTH Must refuse request with invalid x-app-id
       AUTH valid response
getHeros:
       get HEROES with valid response
CreateHeros:
       POST HERO Successful Request
       Must return error if not authenticated
battleHeros:
       POST HERO BATTLE Successful Request

The way of finding a weeker and strong Heros was interating the Battle endpoint and saving result in enviroment.

I noticed that if you send anything that the api is not expeting it return 500 not 400 bad request.
