The base of the test cases are: check response and schema.
Auth:  AUTH Must refuse request without x-app-id
       AUTH Must refuse request with invalid x-app-id
       AUTH valid response
getHeros:
       get HEROES with valid response
CreateHeros:
       POST HERO Successful Request
       Must return error if not authenticated
battleHeros:
       POST HERO BATTLE Successful Request

The way of finding a weaker and stronger Heros was interating the Battle endpoint and saving the result in environment.

I noticed that if you send anything that the api is not expecting it returns 500 not 400 bad requests.
